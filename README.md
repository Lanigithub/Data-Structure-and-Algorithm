# Data Structure and Algorithm: 

### Definition:
* ### Data Structure:  a named location(a way) to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently(primative data structure and non-primative data structure)
* ### Algorithm: the process or instruction(collection of steps) to solve a problem. A set of codes( inside a function ) to do something to the data( sort, arithmetic operations, display, search, backtracking, dynamic  programming...)
***

## Data Structure:

### Primative data structure( integer, float, character, pointer, string...) that can only hold or store one type of data;
### Non-primative data structure: linear and nonlinear
* ### Linear( sequential type of data structure..):
###  Array:
### Classes and Objects
### Linked List:
### Stacks and Queues
### Big O: O notation and time complexity:

 * ###  Nonlinear(user-defined that stores the data of different types in a single entity.): 
### Trees

### Hash(special case of binary tree) Tables and Dictionaries
### Graphs

***
## Algorithim:
### Arithmetic operations: 
### Recursion:
### Sorting and searching:
* ### sort: 
* ### linear search and  Binary Search
### Dynamic Programming:
### Greedy Algorithm: 
### Backtracking 
###
